Model to predict Heart disease
Machine Learning Project1

Topic : Make a ML model to predict whether person has Heart disease or not.
Used: Python, Jupyter notebook 
Step1: Took a data from Kaggle datasets.
Step2: performed EDA
Step3: Build a ML model and predict and checked accuracy.

Observations:
1. Our problem involves a tabular dataset with 18 variables in which we can find categorical and numerical variables and one of them is the target variable. 
2. We are going to Analyze different type of parameters which are given in the dataset and try to find out correlation between them. There are zero null values which will simply our work. 
3. Wow, these data suggest that not consuming alcohol has a correlation with suffering heart disease. But this part also would be advisable to consult with an expert.
4. Given dataset states that males have the maximum numbers of heart disease in comparison to females. 
5. We can easily say that there is a positive correlation between get heart disease and be older. 
6. It also states that white people have more heart disease cases comparison to others. 
7. And if your health status is poor then you might be under threat of heart disease comparison to other health conditions.

About Model:
1.	It is a classification problem so have used two classification models one of them is Logistic Regression and another one is KNN.
2.	After building the model have checked accuracy of the model and compared the accuracy of Logistic regression and KNN.
3.	And we got 91% accuracy of logistic regression and 90% accuracy of KNN.
